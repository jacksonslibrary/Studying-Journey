##  Pivoting Overview
- Have compromised a machine
- Machine gives you access to 2 network interfaces
- Interfaces share a new network that was originally unavailable
- Can setup a proxy to pivot through it

### Setup
- SSH into compromised machine with root access
- Machine has both an eth0 address: 10.10.155.5 and an eth1 address: 10.10.10.5
- Attacker can only communicate with 10.10.155.5
- Use machine to pivot into new network

### Proxy Chain
- `cat /etc/proxychains#.conf`
- Look for socks4 address and port to bind to
- Setup traffic forward: `ssh -f -N -D <socks4 port> -i pivot root@<target machine ip>`
- Connection established with machine and traffic can be proxied through it
- `proxychains <command on other network>`

### sshuttle
- Setup traffic forward: `sshuttle -r root@10.10.155.5 10.10.10.0/24 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i pivot"`
- `<command on other network>`
