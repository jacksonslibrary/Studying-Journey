## Cleaning Up

### From the pentest perspective
- This is best practice
- Leave the system/network as it was when you entered it
  - Remove executables, scripts, and added files
  - Remove malware, rootkits, and added user accounts
  - Set settings back to original configuration

### From the red team perspective
- Make it look like you were never there
- Eliminate yourself from log files
- Make yourself harder to track
