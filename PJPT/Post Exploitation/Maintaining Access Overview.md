## Maintaining Access Overview 
- If something happened to the machine we're on, we have a way to gain access back to it
- Typically as a pentester, you won't do this
- At most, you might add a user

### Techniques
- Persistence Scripts (metasploit)
  - Opens a port with no authentication
  - Very dangerous
  - run persistence -h
  - exploit/windows/local/persistence
  - exploit/windows/local/registry_persistence
- Scheduled Tasks
  - run scheduleme
  - run schtaskabuse
  - Don't worry about this
- Add a user
  - net user hacker password123 /add
  - Loud
