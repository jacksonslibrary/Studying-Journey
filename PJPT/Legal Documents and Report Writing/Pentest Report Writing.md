## Pentest Report Writing
- Confidentiality statement says this document is for us and demo company, nobody else
- Disclaimer says a penetration test is a snapshot in time, some companies should have a longer test
- Contact info has demo company contacts and our contacts
- Assessment Overview is a high level explanation
- Assessment Components explains what the test is
- Finding Severity Rating explains the different finding severity ratings
- Scope says what in and out of scope
- Executive Summary is for executives, c-suite, non-technical staff
- Attack summary describes each step of the attack in simple terms
- Security strengths give kudos
- Security weaknesses are what allows attack, again KISS
- Vulnerabilities by Impact lets you see how well the demo company did
- Findings is the technical section, lots of detail
- Give a PoC for chained attacks
- Additional Reports and Scans are outputs (Nessus scans in Excel and PDF)
