## Reviewing a Real Pentest Report
- 2 week engagement
- Larger client with ~5,000 internal IPs
- 10.x.x.x/8 subnet scope, no DoS, no social engineering
- Executive summary talk about findings at a high level
- CYA by including limitations (scope and time)
- Testing Summary explains the process and story, slightly technical but still readable by c-suite
- Tester Notes and Recommendations sounds like it's coming from the tester's voice
- Started noisy and then progressively less
- Strengths including detecting noisy tools
- Vulnerability Summary and Report Card is colorful and easy to read
- Technical findings go into more detail, most critical first
- First finding is LLMNR Poisoning that leads to compromising the Domain Controller
- Give remediation, guidance, and references
- More cracked password indicate weaker password policy
- Large lists should be in an external document
- Keep everything clean
- Provide Steps to Domain Admin with remediation as an informational finding
- Screenshots should be clean, invert black backgrounds, include border
- Prevent questions
