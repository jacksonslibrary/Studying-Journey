## Post-Domain Compromise Attack Strategy
- Provide as much value to the client as possible
  - Put your blinders on and do it again
  - Dump the NTDS.dit and crack passwords
  - Enumerate shares for sensitive information
- Persistence can be important
  - What happens if our DA access is lost?
  - Create a DS account can be useful (DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE IT)
  - Creating a Golden Ticket can be useful, too
- Do a little dance, probably "Got em!"
