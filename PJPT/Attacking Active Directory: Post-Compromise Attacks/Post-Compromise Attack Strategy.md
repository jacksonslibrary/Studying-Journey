## Post-Compromise Attack Strategy
- We have an account, now what?
- We should be looking for quick wins
  - Kerberoasting
  - Secretsdump
  - Pass-the-hash/password
- No quick wins? Dig deeper!
  - Enumerate (Bloodhound, etc.)
  - Where does your account have access?
  - Old vulnerabilities die hard
- Think outside the box
- How can I move laterally until I can move vertically?
