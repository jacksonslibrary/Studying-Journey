## Introduction
- Foundations of attacking web applications, for a pentest or bug bounty
- Theory and practical labs
- There is no single way to exploit an application, all apps are unique
- CVE's and public exploits are for another time
- Looking at weaknesses in apps, analyzing behavior, and crafting exploits

## Lab Setup
- Need: Burp Suite, Docker IO, Docker Compose
  
  `sudo apt install docker.io`
  
  `sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.29.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
  
  `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
  
  `docker-compose --version`
  
  `Docker Compose version v2.29.1`
