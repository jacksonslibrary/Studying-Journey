## XSS - Stored Lab
### Setup
- Set up containers to have multiple sessions open
- Add the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension
- Load lab in 2 separate containers
- Lab is a simulated forum that lets you add comments

### Testing
- Test for HTML injection first
- It is more likely to work
- Add `<h1>test</h1>` shows test as a header in the comment
- Refreshing on the other container shows the comment proving it is stored
- Add `<script>prompt(1)</script>` showing the prompt, and then on there other container after refreshing
