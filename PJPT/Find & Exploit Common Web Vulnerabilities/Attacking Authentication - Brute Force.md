## Attacking Authentication - Brute Force
- The correct approach and thinking methodically is crucial in successful brute force attacks

Potential tools:
- Burp Suite
- Hydra
- FFuf

Considerations for live systems:
- Might be slow
- Use reasonably sized wordlists
- Can potentially be blocked, lock accounts, or cause instability in our target
- Monitor target to ensure it stays up and the response time are good
- Bug bounties can restrict requests per second to 5 or 3 etc.

- Don't underestimate brute forcing
- Not as easy as it seems

### Brute Force with Burp Suite
- Access the first authentication lab
- We're given a target account called 'jeremy'
- The app has a login for username and password
- Enter `jemery` as the username and `password` as password proxying the request
- Open the request in Burp and send it to intruder
- Highlight `password` and click `add ยง` to mark it
- Under Payload configuration load in a wordlist of passwords
- After starting the attack, sort the results by shortest length

- As we can see `letmein` is a shorter length than the rest

- The response shows 'You have successfully logged in!
- Try it in the browser to verify, and we get the same response

### Brute Force with FFuf
- Copy the original POST request and paste it into a file called `req.txt`
- Change the password to `FUZZ`
- Run `ffuf -request req.txt -request-proto http -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-1000.txt`
- Now we have to filter the size
- Many of them have a size of 1814 so append `-fs 1814`
