## Attacking Authentication - Intro
- Authentication is a critical part of application security
- Basic attacks are often overlooked
- Many flaws are logic based

### Finding Flaws
- Review the authentication flow
- Find edge cases to break the flow

### Authentication vs Authorization
- Authentication is who you are, your identity
- Similar to showing your passport or your ID when you check into a hotel
- Auhtorization is what you're allowed to do
- Once you're checked into the hotel, you get a card key
- This key lets you access your room, the pool, etc

### Approaches
- Brute force attacks: something a lot of development teams underestimate
- Logic issues: can turn out to be critical and usually undetectable by scanners and automated tools
