## SQL Injection - Blind Part 2 
### Blind SQLi
- We found a SQL injection, but this is Blind SQLi
- The query is only changing the behavior of the application
- It either displays the login for or welcome to your dashboard
- It won't give us data from the database

### Plan
- Create payloads that produce true false outputs
- Slowly extract data based on that behavior
- Ask the database yes or no questions
- Is the first letter of the username a? etc.
- Questions allow us to extract information that is not returned on the screen

### Version query
- Example:

Extract 3 characters from a string, starting in position 1:

`SELECT SUBSTRING('SQL Tutorial', 1, 3) AS ExtractString;`

- Append `' and substring('a', 1, 1) = 'a'#` to the cookie
- and the substring 'a' so the first character and the length of one equals 'a'
- This gives us a good response, same content-length
- This is just comparing strings we provide
- Instead, we want to compare this to something we grab from the database
- Append `' and substring((select version()), 1, 1) = '7'#` to the cookie
- This has a change in the content-length so it's not right
- Trying 8, we get a good response, so we know the MySQL version is 8
- Continuing this process, we get the next 5 characters, resulting in 8.0.3 as the version

### Password query
- We don't want to do this manually
- Let's send it to Intruder with Sniper
- With all characters as payload, we start the attack
- Looking at the length, the character that sticks out is `z`

- Could continue with Intruder, but let's try SQLMap

### Automate it with SQLMap
- Create req2.txt with the request
- Run `sqlmap -r req2.txt --level=2`
- SQLMap found the cookie session is vulnerable:

- Adding `--dump -T injection0x02` gives us the table

- It's good to note that a lowercase z got a match previously but the actual password is uppercase
- Just a quirk for SQL
