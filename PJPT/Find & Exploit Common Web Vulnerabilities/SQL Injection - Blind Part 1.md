## SQL Injection - Blind Part 1
- First things to do:
  - Test the apps functionality
  - Understand what it is doing
  - Look at typical responses
  - Look at what kind of behavior is happening
- Add localhost to Burp Suite Target Scope
- Intercept login with default credentials
- Send request to repeater
- Change username to `jeremy' or 1=1#` then use ctrl+u to encode it, ctrl+shift+u to decode it
- Trying a few different usernames didn't perform SQL injection

### Automate it with SQLMap
- Create req.txt with the request
- Run `sqlmap -r req.txt`
- Not injectable

### Try the session cookie
- Once we send the POST request, the session cookie is set
- The next get request includes the cookie
- The app must be processing it in some way
- When thinking about SQL injection, think about everything you're supplying to the app and how it might be used
- Use the content-length to see if responses are differnt
- If it isn't reliable use the search and matches function
- Append `' and 1=1#` to the cookie in the request
- Notice that the response is the same and doesn't fail
- This is an indication of SQL injection

### Why test like this?
- Can help you understand the behavior of the application
- Helps you dig deeper
- Find a meaningful impact for these vulnerabilities
