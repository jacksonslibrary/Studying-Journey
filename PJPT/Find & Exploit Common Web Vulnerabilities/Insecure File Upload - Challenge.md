## Insecure File Upload - Challenge
Objective: Execute a command via a file upload vulnerability
### Normal App Functionality
- Uploaded a png succesfully
- Navigating to `/uplaods/logo.php` verified the upload 
- Tried upload a txt file but the web app said 'Only '.jpg' and '.png' files are allowed.'

### Try Payloads to Bypass File Check
- Proxy a successful upload request with burp and send it to the repeater
- The first thing I'll try is changing the file extention to .php
- The server returned 'The file extension '.php' is not allowed.Sorry, your file was not uploaded.'
- I changed the file extenstion to .phtml and the server accepted it
- Now I'll try to put the payload in after a few lines of image data and removing the rest
- The server accepted the request and I navigated to `/uploads/cmd.phtml?cmd=whoami`
