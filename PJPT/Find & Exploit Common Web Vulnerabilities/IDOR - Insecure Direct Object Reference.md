## IDOR - Insecure Direct Object Reference
### Introduction
- An access control issue allowing requesting a resource with an object ID (e.g. User ID, Product ID, etc.)
- Returns some information about that object
- Trivial to find and exploit
- More common in API driven applications, called BOLA: Broken Object Level Authorization

### Lab
- Access the IDOR lab
- Simulates an account details page
- URL includes an account ID
- Change it from `1009` to `1010`
- Shows another account's details

### Automation
- Use Python to make a list of account IDs `python3 -c 'for i in range(1,2001): print(i)' > num.txt`
- Run `ffuf -u 'http://localhost/labs/e0x02.php?account=FUZZ' -w num.txt`
- Many of them have the size 849, append ` -fs 849` to the command
- FFuf shows the account IDs with valid account details
