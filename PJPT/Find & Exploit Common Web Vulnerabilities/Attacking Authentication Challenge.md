## Attacking Authentication Challenge
- Access the third Authentication Lab
- Objective: Find a valid account and login as that account
- Restriction: Accounts will lock after 5 failed login attempts

### Normal App Functionality
- Enter `admin` as the username and `password` as the password
- The app said "Password incorrect, added a lockout attempt"
- Proxy the request to try to understand how it applying the rate limiting
- Let's guess it locks based on the username

### Attack with Burp Suite
- Send the request to the intruder and added markers around `jeremy` and `password`
- Set the attack type to cluster bomb
- Add a username and password payload for their positions
- Run the attack and sorted the responses by descending length
- Keep checking the longest length until the response showed a successful login

### Attack with FFUF
- Notice the response from the incorrect attempt has a `Content-Length` of 3376
- Replace `admin` with `FUZZUSER` and `password` with `FUZZPASS`
- Copy the request and paste it in a file
- Run `ffuf -request req.txt -request-proto http -mode clusterbomb -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt:FUZZUSER -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-1000.txt:FUZZPASS -fs 3376`
- Getting a lot of responses with length 3256, append `,3256` to the command
- FUFF gets the same login

- Which can then be verified in the browser that the login is successful
