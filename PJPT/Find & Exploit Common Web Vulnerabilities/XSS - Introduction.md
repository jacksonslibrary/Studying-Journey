## XSS - Introduction
- Another famous vulnerability
- Declining due to awareness and frameworks having built-in protection by default
- Still found in modern web apps
- Very flexible and can be used to chain other issues together
- It lets us execute JS in a victims browser
- Often gives us control over the app for that user
- 3 main types: Reflected, stored, and DOM-based
- Reflected: the script you are trying to inject comes from the current HTTP request, script is included in the response
- Stored: payload is stored in a database and retrieved later
- DOM-Based: client side has some vulnerable JS that uses untrusted inputs

### Demo: Manual JS Execution (Not Injection)
- Open browser dev tools console
- Enter `alert(1)`, probably the most common payload
- Tip: Avoid using `alert(1)`, use `print()` or `prompt("hello")`
- `function logKey(event){console.log(event.key)}` then `document.addEventListener('keydown', logkey) to log keys to console
- `console.log` could be replace with a fetch API, for example, and try to exfiltrate data
