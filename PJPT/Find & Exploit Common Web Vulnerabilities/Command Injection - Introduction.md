## Command Injection - Introduction
- Very serious, can often compromise the entire application and host
- App is taking input from the user, passsing it into a function that executes it as code
- Insecure by mixing data and code
- 'eval is evil' as eval is a function that executes data

### Using the Console
- Pull up dev tools in a browser and select the console tab
- Enter `eval(1+1)` which returns `2`
- Enter `let userInput = '7*7' then enter `eval(userInput)` which returns `49` by executing 7*7

### Using the terminal
- Drop into PHP in interactive mode: `php -a`
- Enter `$userInput = 'whoami';` then `system($userInput);` which returns `kali` by executing `whoami`

### Never Trust
- Apps should never trust input; user, third party API call, etc
- Avoid using dangerous fucntions like `eval` and `system`
