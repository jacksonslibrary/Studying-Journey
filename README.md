# Studying Journey
Welcome to my journey in studying cybersecurity, where I document what I'm learning through machine write-ups and note-taking. This repository serves as a personal log and resource as I prepare for various security certifications and challenges as well as for the joy of learning.

## Current Studies

### PJPT
I am currently preparing for the Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) certification from TCM Security. This directory includes machine write-ups for rooted machines from the Practical Ethical Hacking course. This course teaches ethical hacking at an associate level with a major focus on Active Directory Hacking and also includes web application hacking and report writing.

### OWASP Top 10
I am also diving deeper into web application security. To strengthen my understanding, I’m completing the LinkedIn Learning Path titled Master the OWASP Top 10. This learning path includes six courses that explore the most critical security risks to web applications, providing a comprehensive foundation in secure development and testing practices. I’ve created a directory for studying the OWASP Top 10, where I’m taking detailed notes on each topic.

## Machine Write-Ups
Below are the detailed write-ups for machines I've completed during the Practicl Ethical Hacker Course.

- [Blue](PJPT/Blue.md)
- [Academy](PJPT/Academy.md)
- [Dev](PJPT/Dev.md)
- [Butler](PJPT/Butler.md)
- [Blackpearl](PJPT/Blackpearl.md)
- (More write-ups to come as I progress through the course!)

## OWASP Top 10 Notes
Below are notes for each course in the Master the OWASP Top 10 learning path.

- [Learning the OWASP Top 10](OWASP%20Top%2010/Learning%20the%20OWASP%20Top%2010.md) 
- [#1 Broken Access Control and #2 Cryptographic Failures](OWASP%20Top%2010/%231%20Broken%20Access%20Control%20and%20%232%20Cryptographic%20Failures.md))
- (More notes to come as I progress through the Learning Path!)

## Tools & Techniques
Throughout this process, I've used a variety of tools and techniques for penetration testing and web application security:

- **Nmap**: Network discovery and port scanning.
- **netcat**: To create port listeners.
- **Hashcat**: Password cracking.
- **ffuf**: Directory and subdomain fuzzing.
- **LinPEAS**: Linux privilege escalation enumeration script.
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework.
- **pspy**: Tool for monitoring processes for privilege escalation.
- **john**: To crack password hashes.
- **winPEAS**: To search for possible local privilege escalation paths on Windows.
- **MSFvenom**: To create payloads.
- **Burp Suite**: For modifying requests and brute forcing logins.

## Lessons Learned
Throughout my studying journey, I've learned the following key lessons:
- The importance of thorough enumeration.
- How privilege escalation opportunities are often hidden in plain sight (e.g., weak credentials, misconfigured services).
- The value of automation balanced with manual exploration.
- The significance of clear, structured reporting.
