# Studying Journey
Welcome to my journey in studying cybersecurity, where I document what I'm learning through machine write-ups and note-taking. This repository serves as a personal log and resource as I prepare for various security certifications and challenges as well as for the joy of learning.

## Current Studies

### OSCP
Curently trying harder. Notes are private per Offsec.

## Machine Write-Ups
Below are the detailed write-ups for the captstone machines.

- [Blue](PJPT/New%20Capstone/Blue.md)
- [Academy](PJPT/New%20Capstone/Academy.md)
- [Dev](PJPT/New%20Capstone/Dev.md)
- [Butler](PJPT/New%20Capstone/Butler.md)
- [Blackpearl](PJPT/New%20Capstone/Blackpearl.md)

## Tools & Techniques
Throughout this process, I've used a variety of tools and techniques for penetration testing and web application security:

- **Nmap**: Network discovery and port scanning.
- **netcat**: To create port listeners.
- **Hashcat**: Password cracking.
- **ffuf**: Directory and subdomain fuzzing.
- **LinPEAS**: Linux privilege escalation enumeration script.
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework.
- **pspy**: Tool for monitoring processes for privilege escalation.
- **john**: To crack password hashes.
- **winPEAS**: To search for possible local privilege escalation paths on Windows.
- **MSFvenom**: To create payloads.
- **Burp Suite**: For modifying requests and brute forcing logins.

## Lessons Learned
Throughout my studying journey, I've learned the following key lessons:
- The importance of thorough enumeration.
- How privilege escalation opportunities are often hidden in plain sight (e.g., weak credentials, misconfigured services).
- The value of automation balanced with manual exploration.
- The significance of clear, structured reporting.
